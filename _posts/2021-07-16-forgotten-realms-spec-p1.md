Forgotten Realms is a wonderfully flavorful set, but unfortunately heavily overshadowed by existing standard sets. Overall the power level of the set feels far lower than it's current brothers and sisters and I suspect for the formats I personally care about (EDH), only a handful of cards will make the cut. 

On the positive side, my EDH interests lies with Dragon tribal under the helm of The Ur-Dragon and a new equipment deck I'm currently brewing, so flavor-wise this set is a slam dunk with a swath of new dragons and equipments. Let's take a look at a few I'm interested in.

## The Mythic Big Boys

At a glance, most of them are unfortunately dissapointing. Although perhaps true to their distinctive origin and lore, most of their effects don't translate well or powerfully on table top.

### Icingdeath, Frost Tyrant

For 2WW, you get a 4/3 Flying, Vigilant beat stick. When it dies, you get a marginally bad equipment that 'freezes' a creature. I think the travesty or failure here is that Icingdeath itself doesn't make use of its own freezing ability. The fact that it must die and you must equip the actual equipment first for only a measly single creature freeze is dissapointing. 

Art-wise though, it looks beautiful, so there's that. I suspect this will become a long-term bargain bin pickup and something I would run in Ur-Dragon as a 3CMC early beatstick. I wouldn't pay more than 1-2 USD for this.

### Lymrith, Desert Doom

![lymrith](/assets/lymrith.png)

At first glance, Lymrith reminds me of Ojutai.

![ojutai](/assets/ojutai.png)

Both are 5CMC 5 power beatsticks that have some sort of protection while untapped. Ward 4 here is worse than Hexproof, but where they differ is their card-draw-on-damage-dealth ability.

Ojutai allows you to anticipate on damage, which is always 1 card, but you get to dig 3 cards deep, whereas Lymrith allows you to straght up draw 1, then up to 2 more depending on hand size.

Ojutai promotes holding a healthy hand size and sculpting your answers, whereas Lymrith promotes dumping your hand to get you more gas.

I actually think Lymrith stands on his own here. He's similar to Ojutai, but not necessarily worse, The ability to draw up to 3 in a dragon tribal deck where you're typically not going to slot in too many card draw is tangible and strong. Ward 4 isn't as good as Ojutais straight hexproof, but honestly hexproof wasn't that great on Ojutai anyways as you would always want to turn him sideways everyturn.

Lymrith is a decent include in my deck and will be attempting to obtain a copy for a price similar to Ojutai's current going rate around 2-3 USD.

### Ebondeath, Dracolich

When I see Ebondeath, I like to compare it to a similar 4 CMC black recurring dragon - Boneyard Scourge.

![boneyard](/assets/boneyard.png)

They're similar in the sense that they both have clauses that allow them to come back when a creature dies. Ebondeath triggers on _any_ creature effectively, yours or your opponents, whereas Boneyard only triggers on Dragons you control. Granted if you're running a Dragon edh deck like me, the dragon clause is moot, but the tangible difference is that Ebondeath can come back on any of your opponents creatures dying. 

OK, so Ebondeath wins on that category. The other part is that Ebondeath requires its full casting cost whereas Boneyard's recurring cost is a measly 1B. 

Ebondeath comes in tapped and Boneyard doesn't.

Ebondeath has flash (but it has to come in tapped anyways) which makes it a cute thing to be able to flash in what is effectively a 1BB 5/2 on the end phase of your opponent's turn. 

Instinctively, I think Boneyard Scourge is better. Although Ebondeath has flash, it's clause that makes it come in tapped is a huge negative. Flash pretty much becomes moot after it's initial cast. The main selling point for me is its ability to be casted on any creature death, which will probably mean Ebondeath has more opportunities to hit the board compared to Boneyard especially if one of your opponents is playing some sort of aristocrat sac deck.

With that said though, Ebondeath has a very kosher art and having both Ebondeath and Boneyard Scourge certainly helps with rebuilding post-wiped boards.

I personally will be running Ebondeath over boneyard despite the higher casting cost. For me, Ebondeath isn't a terrible downgrade from Boneyard, as it's recurring clause has some positive merit over Boneyards.

### Inferno of the Star Mounts

![inferno](/assets/inferno.png)

Alright, so what does Inferno compete with in the 4RR dragon slot with similar key words, Flying and Haste?

Pretty much just Hellkite Charger.

![hellkite](/assets/hellkite.png)

[OK, what if we loosen up the keywords a bit?](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&color=+@(+[R])&subtype=+[dragon]&cmc=+=[6])

I think there are better options.

At 4RR you can get access to Hellkite Courser, Hellkite Tyrant, Lathliss Dragon Queen, and at 3RRR you can get Moonveil Dragon in which I would argue probably edges out Inferno just by a tiny bit.

![moonveil](/assets/moonveil.png)

I would argue Inferno is a strictly better Shivan Dragon and Rorix Bladewing, but I would take any of the beforementioned cards before Inferno.

Now let's say you already have all those aforementioned cards and you're looking to add something more gimmicky/spicey. Then that's where Inferno shines in my opinion.

If you're running a dragon EDH, you're probably also running cards like Crucible of Fire, or other cards that may be pumping the power of your dragons. If you're running Ur-Dragon, you're probably also running a decent assortment of ramp to get you to the 9CMC to power out Ur-Dragon. Inferno, although a lackluster card, is at the very least a half decent fast beater that will occasionally turn heads and force your opponents to be wary of your mana.

Again, I would make sure you obtain your core dragon cards first, then consider Inferno has a potential casual gimmick/head-turner.


### Old Gnawbone

Now this is a house. Out of the five dragons, it's quite apparent that this is the one with the real _mythic_ Timmy-like ability. 

In the context of a dragon deck, this is a slam dunk. Dragons are all built like houses and hit hard, and you'll be rich if you survive a turn rotation after playing this card and being able to swing with it.

In a context of just generic EDH, this is a fantastic green beatstick with a great effect. Treasure tokens are ramp that any deck with green can appreciate. Any deck that plays green will more often than not also have some sort of focus on large creatures. 

It's interesting how this is the dragon with the least amount of text and by extensions, restrictions on its ability, and it turns out to be the best one.

Get a copy, period.

## Uncommon Dragons

Don't.
